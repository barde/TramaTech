# Troubleshooting Guide

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Material Preparation Issues

#### Problem: Amadou is too stiff to work with
**Symptoms**: Cracks when bent, difficult to cut, won't conform to curves

**Solutions**:
1. **Light Treatment**:
   - Mist lightly with water
   - Place in sealed bag for 2 hours
   - Work by hand to soften

2. **Glycerin Treatment**:
   - Mix 1 part glycerin with 10 parts water
   - Spray or brush on both sides
   - Let absorb for 30 minutes
   - Work material until pliable

3. **Steam Method**:
   - Hold over boiling water (not touching)
   - 30-60 seconds exposure
   - Work immediately while warm

#### Problem: Amadou tears easily
**Symptoms**: Rips during cutting, falls apart, brittle

**Causes & Solutions**:
- **Old/Degraded Material**: Use as backing layer only
- **Over-dried**: Apply glycerin treatment above
- **Poor Quality**: Source from reputable suppliers
- **Wrong Cutting Technique**: Use sharper blade, single pass cuts

#### Problem: Uneven thickness
**Symptoms**: Bumpy surface, poor adhesion, uncomfortable wear

**Solutions**:
1. Split thicker areas carefully with knife
2. Sand gently with 220 grit sandpaper
3. Use as inner layer with thinner outer piece
4. Hammer more during preparation

### Adhesion Problems

#### Problem: Glue won't stick to amadou
**Symptoms**: Edges lifting, complete detachment, poor bond

**Solutions**:
1. **Surface Preparation**:
   - Clean with isopropyl alcohol
   - Let dry completely
   - Lightly sand if too smooth
   - Remove all debris

2. **Adhesive Selection**:
   - Switch to contact cement
   - Try E6000 for flexibility
   - Use leather-specific glue
   - Test on scraps first

3. **Application Technique**:
   - Apply thin, even layers
   - Wait for proper tack
   - Press firmly
   - Use clamps while drying

#### Problem: Adhesive bleeding through
**Symptoms**: Visible glue spots, discoloration, stiff areas

**Prevention**:
- Use less adhesive
- Apply with brush, not squeeze
- Avoid water-based glues
- Test on hidden area first

**Fixes**:
- Sand affected area lightly
- Cover with thin amadou patch
- Use leather dye to hide
- Accept as character

### Cutting Issues

#### Problem: Edges are ragged
**Symptoms**: Frayed edges, uneven cuts, torn fibers

**Solutions**:
1. **Blade Sharpness**:
   - Replace or sharpen blade
   - Use fresh razor blade
   - Try rotary cutter
   - Consider scissors for curves

2. **Cutting Technique**:
   - Single confident pass
   - Don't saw back and forth
   - Support material fully
   - Cut on proper surface

3. **Material Preparation**:
   - Slightly dampen for clean cuts
   - Freeze for 10 minutes for precision
   - Use template and weights

### Fit Problems

#### Problem: Cushions too thick for headphones
**Symptoms**: Cups won't close, pressure on ears, distorted sound

**Solutions**:
1. Split amadou layer thinner
2. Remove internal foam padding
3. Compress more during installation
4. Sand down thickness gradually

#### Problem: Cushions too thin
**Symptoms**: Uncomfortable, poor seal, drivers touching ears

**Solutions**:
1. Add foam backing layer
2. Double up amadou layers
3. Use thicker starting material
4. Add memory foam insert

#### Problem: Shape doesn't match cups
**Symptoms**: Gaps, poor seal, uneven pressure

**Solutions**:
1. Remake template more carefully
2. Stretch amadou when warm
3. Add small filler pieces
4. Trim gradually to fit

### Performance Issues

#### Problem: Reduced ANC effectiveness
**Symptoms**: More ambient noise, ANC seems weaker

**Expected**: This is normal - amadou doesn't seal as tightly as synthetic leather

**Mitigation**:
- Ensure good fit around ears
- Add thin foam gasket at edges
- Compress amadou more
- Accept trade-off for comfort

#### Problem: Sound quality changes
**Symptoms**: Less bass, different soundstage, hollow sound

**Solutions**:
1. Check seal around ears
2. Ensure cushions aren't too thick
3. Add dampening material if needed
4. Break-in period may help

#### Problem: Comfort issues
**Symptoms**: Pressure points, itching, too warm

**Solutions**:
1. **Pressure Points**:
   - Reshape while damp
   - Add padding in specific areas
   - Trim high spots

2. **Itching**:
   - Rare but possible sensitivity
   - Apply barrier layer (thin fabric)
   - Condition with natural oil

3. **Temperature**:
   - Normal warming effect
   - Will regulate after break-in
   - Consider perforations

### Durability Concerns

#### Problem: Edges wearing quickly
**Symptoms**: Fraying, peeling, deterioration

**Solutions**:
1. Seal edges with diluted glue
2. Add fabric binding
3. Wax treatment for protection
4. Reinforce with stitching

#### Problem: Surface getting dirty
**Symptoms**: Discoloration, stains, odor

**Cleaning Methods**:
1. **Light Cleaning**:
   - Dry brush regularly
   - Damp cloth with mild soap
   - Air dry completely

2. **Deep Cleaning**:
   - Saddle soap application
   - Gentle scrub with soft brush
   - Condition after cleaning

3. **Stain Removal**:
   - Immediate blotting
   - Cornstarch for oil stains
   - Diluted vinegar for odors

### Long-term Maintenance

#### Problem: Material drying out
**Symptoms**: Stiffness returning, cracking, brittleness

**Maintenance Schedule**:
- Monthly: Dust and inspect
- Quarterly: Light conditioning
- Annually: Deep conditioning

**Conditioning Options**:
1. Neatsfoot oil (traditional)
2. Leather conditioner (modern)
3. Jojoba oil (natural)
4. Lanolin (water resistance)

#### Problem: Shape loss
**Symptoms**: Flattening, conforming too much, losing structure

**Solutions**:
1. Store with shape supports
2. Rotate usage if possible
3. Reshape when damp
4. Accept natural conforming
