# Materials Science: Understanding Amadou/Trama

## What is Amadou?

Amadou is a spongy material derived from the trama layer of *Fomes fomentarius* (tinder fungus, hoof fungus, or false tinder fungus). This bracket fungus grows primarily on birch and beech trees across the Northern Hemisphere.

## Scientific Classification

- **Kingdom**: Fungi
- **Division**: Basidiomycota
- **Class**: Agaricomycetes
- **Order**: Polyporales
- **Family**: Polyporaceae
- **Genus**: Fomes
- **Species**: F. fomentarius

## The Trama Layer

### Structure
The trama is the sterile tissue that makes up the bulk of the fungal fruiting body, located between:
- **Upper layer**: Hard, woody crust (cuticle)
- **Lower layer**: Pore surface (hymenophore)
- **Middle layer**: The trama - our material of interest

### Composition
- **Chitin**: Primary structural component (similar to insect exoskeletons)
- **β-glucans**: Polysaccharides providing flexibility
- **Proteins**: Various structural proteins
- **Melanin**: Provides color and antimicrobial properties

## Traditional Processing Methods

### Historical Technique (Korond Method)

1. **Harvesting** (Autumn/Spring)
   - Select mature fungi (3+ years old)
   - Remove from dead or dying trees
   - Sustainable collection practices

2. **Initial Preparation**
   - Remove outer crust
   - Slice trama layer (5-10mm thick)
   - Air dry for initial moisture reduction

3. **Softening Process**
   - Soak in water (24-48 hours)
   - Some traditions add wood ash (potassium carbonate)
   - Alternative: Sodium carbonate solution

4. **Mechanical Processing**
   - Beat with wooden mallets
   - Stretch repeatedly
   - Compress and flatten
   - Repeat until felt-like consistency

5. **Final Treatment**
   - Dry slowly in shade
   - Optional: Oil treatment for suppleness
   - Traditional: Horse urine (ammonia content)
   - Modern: Dilute ammonia solution

### Modern Adaptations
