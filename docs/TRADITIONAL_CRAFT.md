# Traditional Amadou Craft: From Forest to Fabric

## Historical Overview

### Ancient Origins

The use of *Fomes fomentarius* dates back to the Paleolithic era. The most famous evidence comes from Ötzi the Iceman (3,300 BCE), who carried carefully prepared amadou in his pouch, demonstrating the material's importance for survival in prehistoric times.

## The Last Amadou Makers: Korond, Transylvania

### Geographic Context

- **Coordinates**: 46°28′N 25°11′E
- **Population**: ~6,000

### The Craft's Journey to Korond

The amadou craft arrived in Transylvania in the 1700s, likely through Austro-Hungarian trade routes from Bavaria and Bohemia. The craft was introduced to Korond by **János Filep**, a local postmaster, in the 1860s. By the early 1900s, Korond had become the largest amadou-making community in the world with over 100 active craftsmen.

### The Seven Families

Today, only seven families maintain the tradition:

1. **Fabian Imre** - Third generation craftsman
2. **Fabian Zoltan** - Specializes in hats
3. **Molnos István** - Traditional techniques
4. **Tofalvi Erzsébet** - Women's items specialist
5. **Mathe Magdolna** - Decorative pieces
6. **Jozsa Erzsébet** - Teaching workshops
7. **One unnamed family** - Private production

### Local Terminology

- **Taplászat**: The craft of amadou-making
- **Taplász**: Amadou craftsperson
- **Tapló**: The fungus itself
- **Taplókalap**: Amadou hat

## Traditional Processing Technique

### Step 1: Harvesting (Gyűjtés)

**Season**: Late autumn or early spring
- Moisture content optimal
- Fungus fully mature
- Trees dormant

**Selection Criteria**:
- Minimum 3 years old
- 10-40cm diameter
- Firm but not dried
- No insect damage
- Growing on dead birch preferred

**Sustainable Practices**:
- Never from living trees
- Leave young specimens
- Rotate harvesting areas
- One fungus per tree maximum

### Step 2: Initial Preparation (Előkészítés)

1. **Cleaning**: Remove debris, moss
2. **Aging**: Store 2-4 weeks in dry place
3. **Sectioning**: Cut into workable pieces
4. **Layer Separation**:
   - Remove hard outer crust (kéreg)
   - Isolate trama layer (középső réteg)
   - Remove pore layer (alsó réteg)

### Step 3: The Soaking Process (Áztatás)

**Traditional Method**:
```
Water + Wood Ash Solution
- 10 liters water
- 500g hardwood ash
- Soak 24-72 hours
- Change solution daily
```

**Purpose**:
- Softens fibers
- Removes tannins
- Prepares for beating
- Natural alkaline treatment

### Step 4: The Beating Process (Verés)

This is the most critical and labor-intensive step:

1. **Tools Required**:
   - Wooden mallet (fakalapács)
   - Smooth stone or hardwood surface
   - Water basin for rinsing

2. **Technique**:
   - Beat systematically, not randomly
   - Start from center, work outward
   - Turn frequently
   - Stretch between beatings
   - Rinse periodically

3. **Duration**: 
   - 4-8 hours per piece
   - Multiple sessions over days
   - Cannot be rushed

4. **Signs of Completion**:
   - Felt-like consistency
   - Uniform thickness
   - No hard spots
   - Flexible when dry

### Step 5: Final Processing (Befejezés)

1. **Shaping**: Stretch to final form
2. **Pressing**: Between boards with weight
3. **Drying**: Slow, controlled, away from sun
4. **Conditioning**: Optional oil treatment
5. **Quality Check**: Flexibility, evenness

## Regional Variations

### Japanese Interest (Modern)
- Scientific approach
- Precise measurements
- Automated beating attempts
- Mixed results
