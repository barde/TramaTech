# Jabra Elite 85h Headphone Modification with Tinder Fungus Trama

## Project Overview

Transform your Jabra Elite 85h headphones by replacing synthetic leather ear cushions with breathable, natural tinder fungus trama. This modification eliminates the common issues of sweating and discomfort during extended wear while adding a unique, sustainable touch to your audio gear.

## üìã Materials Needed

### Primary Materials
- **Tinder fungus trama leather** (2 pieces, approximately 10x10 cm each)
  - Pre-processed amadou from Corund, Romania (recommended)
  - OR self-processed trama from locally foraged *Fomes fomentarius*
- **Kn√∂fix adhesive** (water-based, flexible when dry)
  - Alternative: Any flexible fabric glue

### Tools Required
- Sharp craft knife or scalpel
- Small hammer (for flattening)
- Cutting mat or protective surface
- Ruler or measuring tape
- Pencil for marking
- Fine sandpaper (optional, for edge finishing)
- Small scissors for detail work

## üîß Step-by-Step Instructions

### Phase 1: Preparation (15 minutes)

1. **Remove Original Ear Cushions**
   - Gently twist and pull the original cushions from the headphone cups
   - Clean any residual adhesive from the mounting rings
   - Set aside the original cushions as templates

2. **Prepare Trama Material**
   - If using raw trama, ensure it's properly dried and flattened
   - Check thickness - ideal is 3-5mm for comfort and acoustics
   - Condition the trama by gently working it with your hands for flexibility

### Phase 2: Pattern Creation (10 minutes)

3. **Create Templates**
   - Place original cushions on paper
   - Trace both the outer and inner circles
   - Add 5mm seam allowance around outer edge for tucking

4. **Transfer to Trama**
   - Place template on trama
   - Mark with pencil (marks will be hidden)
   - Note the grain direction for consistent appearance

### Phase 3: Cutting and Shaping (15 minutes)

5. **Cut the Trama**
   - Use sharp knife for clean edges
   - Cut slightly outside the marked lines
   - Make relief cuts around inner circle for easier folding

6. **Shape and Refine**
   - Gently hammer edges to thin them for easier folding
   - Test fit on headphone cups
   - Trim any excess material

### Phase 4: Attachment (15 minutes)

7. **Apply Adhesive**
   - Apply thin layer of Kn√∂fix to mounting ring
   - Work in sections to prevent premature drying
   - Allow to become tacky (2-3 minutes)

8. **Mount the Trama**
   - Start at one point and work around
   - Stretch gently for smooth surface
   - Tuck edges under mounting ring
   - Press firmly and hold for 30 seconds per section

### Phase 5: Finishing (5 minutes)

9. **Final Adjustments**
   - Trim any visible excess with scissors
   - Smooth any wrinkles by gentle stretching
   - Allow adhesive to cure for 2 hours before use

## üìä Results & Performance

### Acoustic Changes
| Aspect | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Comfort** | Sweaty, sticky | Breathable, dry |
| **Sound Quality** | Standard | Warmer, more natural |
| **Noise Cancellation** | 100% effective | ~85% effective |
| **Wear Duration** | 2-3 hours max | 5+ hours comfortable |

### Comfort Improvements
- **Temperature Regulation**: Natural fibers allow air circulation
- **Moisture Management**: Trama absorbs and releases moisture naturally
- **Skin Feel**: Soft, warm touch vs synthetic coldness

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### ANC Performance
The natural texture and density of trama affects the seal around your ears. While Active Noise Cancellation remains functional, expect a 10-15% reduction in effectiveness. This is often an acceptable trade-off for the comfort gains.

### Maintenance
- Clean with slightly damp cloth
- Allow to air dry completely
- Reapply conditioning oil annually (jojoba or similar)
- Expected lifespan: 2-3 years with regular use

## üí° Tips & Tricks

1. **Perfect Fit**: Slightly dampen the trama before mounting for easier stretching
2. **Edge Sealing**: Use beeswax on cut edges to prevent fraying
3. **Color Matching**: Natural trama ages to a beautiful patina
4. **Reversibility**: Keep original cushions for potential warranty claims

## üî¨ Technical Considerations

### Why It Works
- **Acoustic Transparency**: Trama's cellular structure doesn't significantly impede sound waves
- **Natural Damping**: Provides subtle acoustic damping that many find pleasing
- **Breathability**: Open cell structure prevents moisture buildup

### Potential Modifications
- Add thin cotton backing for extra durability
- Experiment with trama thickness for optimal bass response
- Try different attachment methods (sewing for removable option)

## ü§î FAQ

**Q: Will this void my warranty?**  
A: Possibly. Keep original parts and document that modification is reversible.

**Q: How does it smell?**  
A: Fresh trama has a mild, earthy mushroom scent that fades within days.

**Q: Can I wash them?**  
A: Spot clean only. Trama is naturally antimicrobial.

**Q: Where can I buy prepared trama?**  
A: Contact artisans in Corund, Romania, or prepare your own (see traditional techniques guide).
