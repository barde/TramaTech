## 🍄 Project Overview

**TramaTech** demonstrates how traditional European fungal leather crafting can enhance modern technology. This DIY project replaces synthetic leather ear cushions on Jabra Elite 85h headphones and augments an orthopedic arm rest using amadou (trama) - a sustainable, breathable material made from *Fomes fomentarius* (tinder fungus).

### ✨ Key Benefits Achieved

- **Superior Comfort**: No more sweating during extended wear
- **Enhanced Sound Quality**: Improved acoustic properties  
- **Natural Warmth**: Comfortable temperature regulation
- **Sustainable Materials**: Using traditional, renewable resources
- **Quick Implementation**: ~1 hour build time

### ⚠️ Trade-offs

- **ANC Performance**: Slightly reduced Active Noise Cancellation seal
- **Aesthetic**: Unique, rustic appearance may not suit all preferences

## 🌍 Historical Background

### The Ancient Craft of Amadou

Amadou, also known as trama leather, has been crafted from the tinder fungus (*Fomes fomentarius*) for over 5,000 years. Archaeological evidence shows that Ötzi the Iceman carried amadou in 3,300 BCE for fire-starting and medicinal purposes.

### The Last Amadou Makers of Europe

Today, this traditional craft survives only in **Korond (Corund), Transylvania, Romania** (Harghita County), where seven families maintain the ancient techniques of "taplászat" (the local term for amadou-making). This community represents the last active amadou craftsmen in Europe, preserving knowledge passed down since the 1860s.
