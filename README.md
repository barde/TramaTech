## 🍄 Project Overview

**TramaTech** demonstrates how traditional European fungal leather crafting can enhance modern technology. This DIY project replaces synthetic leather ear cushions on Jabra Elite 85h headphones and augments an orthopedic arm rest using amadou (trama) - a sustainable, breathable material made from *Fomes fomentarius* (tinder fungus).

### ✨ Key Benefits Achieved

- **Superior Comfort**: No more sweating during extended wear
- **Enhanced Sound Quality**: Improved acoustic properties  
- **Natural Warmth**: Comfortable temperature regulation
- **Sustainable Materials**: Using traditional, renewable resources
- **Quick Implementation**: ~1 hour build time

### ⚠️ Trade-offs

- **ANC Performance**: Slightly reduced Active Noise Cancellation seal
- **Aesthetic**: Unique, rustic appearance may not suit all preferences

## 🌍 Historical Background

### The Ancient Craft of Amadou

Amadou, also known as trama leather, has been crafted from the tinder fungus (*Fomes fomentarius*) for over 5,000 years. Archaeological evidence shows that Ötzi the Iceman carried amadou in 3,300 BCE for fire-starting and medicinal purposes.

### The Last Amadou Makers of Europe

Today, this traditional craft survives only in **Korond (Corund), Transylvania, Romania** (Harghita County), where seven families maintain the ancient techniques of "taplászat" (the local term for amadou-making). This community represents the last active amadou craftsmen in Europe, preserving knowledge passed down since the 1860s.

## 🛠️ Quick Start Guide

### Time Required
- Preparation: 15 minutes
- Modification: 45 minutes
- Total: ~1 hour

### Difficulty Level
⭐⭐⭐☆☆ (Intermediate - requires careful cutting and gluing)

### What You'll Need

#### Materials
- **Amadou/Trama sheets** (10x10cm minimum)
  - Purchase directly from [my source](https://www.etsy.com/de-en/listing/802350229/amadou-pieces-fly-fishing) or [Korond craftsmen](https://www.facebook.com/AmadouTransylvania/) 
- **Knöfix glue** or similar leather adhesive
- **Jabra Elite 85h headphones** (or similar over-ear model)
- Optional: Orthopedic arm rest for second project

#### Tools
- Sharp craft knife or scalpel
- Small hammer for flattening
- Cutting mat
- Ruler or template
- Fine sandpaper (optional)
- Isopropyl alcohol for cleaning

### Construction Technique

**Two-Layer Trama Design**: This modification uses a dual-layer approach for optimal comfort and durability:
- **Middle Layer**: Harder trama piece positioned between the plastic cushion element and top layer
- **Top Layer**: Especially soft trama for direct skin contact
- Both layers are bonded together using a small amount of Knöfix glue

### Basic Steps

1. **Remove Original Cushions**: Carefully detach synthetic leather from headphones
2. **Create Templates**: Trace original cushion shapes onto paper
3. **Cut Trama**: Use templates to cut both hard and soft amadou sheets precisely
4. **Layer Assembly**: Apply thin layer of Knöfix between trama pieces
5. **Prepare Surface**: Clean adhesive areas with isopropyl alcohol
6. **Apply Adhesive**: Use Knöfix glue sparingly on both surfaces
7. **Attach & Shape**: Position layered trama, hammer gently for adhesion
8. **Finishing Touches**: Trim excess with sharp knife
